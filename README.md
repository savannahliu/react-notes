# React Notes Webapp

## Description  
A post it note style app where users can add notes, move them around, edit them, and delete them. This React app will use Firebase as itâ€™s backend to store collections of notes. The position of notes will also be stored, so people in multiple browsers can edit and arrange them in realtime. The notes themselves will support markdown notation and editing.
